### Basic Feature
By using Emojizer you can convert this

Into

> “I am in my 🚗 😕 about whether I will be 🔛 time The 🚋 was delayed and I was 🏃‍♂️ away from the police 👨 Its 🆗 now though Please ☎️ me later maybe we can have 🅰️ 🍕 tonight while watching 📺”


### Advance mode
And this will be the basic functionality of this application. But if you want to go more advanced, you can switch the advance mode on ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67839176/154834279-a33fe381-1445-49bc-a8eb-136c1a04cb9f.png) and convert the above same text into this,

But wait a minute, things are not quite right, isn’t it? Don’t worry, Emojizer brings you an amazing feature to correct the wrong emojis. Clicking on an emoji or a word box will toggle between the suggested emojis. You can change the emoji or reset it back to the word.

And always the emojis that were generated by the advance mode will have a green border around the box. So that you can easily identify the emoji that should consider being changed.

### Advance edit 
Mmmmm……. But sometimes, changing the emojis by toggling on the box will take some time, and it's a bit difficult to choose the correct emoji, right? And this is where the advance edit feature comes in. Switching the  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67839176/154834351-f8152adc-3e53-4da6-b18f-1470e2e199f2.png)  feature will allow you to change the emoji by selecting from a popup box.

From this pop-up box, you can select the emoji or the default text easily.
But what If the emoji you want is not suggested? By using the emoji search box, you can easily search for emojis.
